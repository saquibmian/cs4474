Lab 2 is now available.  Again, note that much of its length is due
to code listings and program output.

This concludes some of the drier, initial concepts that we needed to
get out of the way.  The remainder of the labs will focus solely on
networking concepts, and, with the exception of lab 3, should be a bit
shorter.
