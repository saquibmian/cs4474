I wrote the midterm this weekend.  It consists of 77 multiple choice questions,
and 2 (very) short answer questions.  Of the multiple choice, 20 are true/false,
and a few are multiple-multiples.

The exam took me 27 minutes to finish (and I was carefully reading each question
as a student taking the exam would).  Even if takes you three times as long,
you should still have about 20 minutes to check over your work at the end.  All
multiple choice questions are equally weighted (1 mark each), so pace yourself
at one question/minute, and move on if you are stuck on a question.

The questions cover every section from 1.1 - 3.4, as well as labs 1 and 3.
If you've been coming to class and following the material, I think you'll find the
exam quite doable.

Just a reminder that I'll hold office hours on Tuesday from 3 - 5 PM for any
last-minute questions.  Good luck with your studies, and I'll see you Wednesday.
