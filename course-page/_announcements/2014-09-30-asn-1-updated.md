Assignment 1 has been updated with a few minor changes to simplify things a
bit:

* Lines are now terminated by `\r\n` instead of `\n`
* Expressions are now limited to 78 chars instead of 79 chars
* Removed `fp-not-supported` error code &mdash; just return `invalid-expr`

Lab 3 is still in development.  I took the weekend to code the assignment
so that I could focus the discussion of the lab and tailor it exactly to
what you'll need for the assignment.

Don't underestimate the assignment.  Implementing the expression parsing
took me longer than I expected.  Start early.  Get the parsing implemented
first, and then add networking after, as discussed in class.  I'll get the
lab out in the next few days, but if you're ready to move on to the
networking part of the assignment before then, see Beej's guide (linked in
the assignment description).
