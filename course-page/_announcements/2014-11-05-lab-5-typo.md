There was an error in the lab 5 exercise.  The signature of the `receive_message_with_timeout`
function was given as:

```
message* receive_message_with_timeout(int sockfd, int timeout, host* source);
```

Instead, it should be:

```
message_t* receive_message_with_timeout(int sockfd, int timeout, host_t* source);
```

The error has been fixed in the lab manual.
