The DNS part of assignment 3 has been slightly modified (the records have changed a bit).

Also, I've decided to allow you to work in pairs on assignment 3.  Regardless of which protocol
you choose to work with, you may work alone or work with a partner.  If you work with a
partner, both students will receive the same grade.  

If you're going to partner up, please let me know who you're working with.  Also, I suggest
sitting down and doing pairing sessions, rather than splitting up the work and working
individually.  You'll be surprised how productive pairing sessions can be, with two sets
of eyes looking over the problem at hand and quickly catching problems that may arise.
