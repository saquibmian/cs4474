Assignment 3 is posted and will be due Wednesday December 03 at 23:59:59.

Feel free to email me with questions you might have.  Lab 6 introduces
Amazon EC2 and helps you start your assignment by getting your EC2 instance
set up.

For this assignment, you have a choice of the type of client you'd like
to build.  If you want a reasonably easy assignment, choose to install
the DNS server and implement the DNS client.

If you'd like a bigger challenge (and up to 20% in bonus marks), you
can choose to install an IRC server and implement an IRC client.

If you'd like to work with a protocol not specified in the assignment,
contact me.

Note that, for this assignment, to ease your end-of-term workload, at
least to some extent, we will not be marking you on style or comments.
We hope that you will try to hand in reasonably clean and modular code,
but we will not assign marks to this.  This should save you time, as 
you won't have to worry about going back and cleaning up / commenting
your code at the end.

Have fun!
