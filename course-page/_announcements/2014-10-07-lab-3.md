Lab 3 is (finally) posted.  I apologize for the delay.

This will be the longest lab you'll have to do.  Keep in mind,
though, that there are lots of code samples that take up a lot
of space.

The lab takes you through the development of a client and server
from start to finish.  After you're done, you should be able
to easily modify the code you write in the lab to add networking
support to your assignment 1 code.
