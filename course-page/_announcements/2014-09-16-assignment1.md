Revamping the Automarking system for this course has taken longer than expected.  We will adjust the assignment and lab schedule accordingly.  We'll discuss it in class tomorrow, but the plan is to push assignment 1 back by a week, releasing it next week.  The first labs will be released later this week to allow you to get started on it.
