We've had a disk failure in the department that is going to require me to work long into the night tonight.  Consequently, I'm going to cancel class tomorrow.  Take the time to work on your assignment, and we'll pick things up on Friday.

If anyone needs assistance, I'm available as always via email.  I'll also add an office hour from 4:00 - 5:00 tomorrow in case you want to come by and get help.

Just a reminder that if you need me to look at your code and help you debug things, it should be placed in a private GitHub Gist (http://gist.github.com) and should be fully runnable -- please don't paste code directly in an email.  To make it quick and easy for me to help you, I should be able to clone the Gist into a VM, compile it, and run it.

Good luck with your assignments and I will see you all on Friday.
