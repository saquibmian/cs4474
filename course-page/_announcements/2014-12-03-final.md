Just a reminder that the final exam is on Saturday at 09:00 AM in SSC 2036.

As noted in class today, the exam is cumulative and covers everything we covered
in the course, with an emphasis on material covered since the midterm.  The exam
will be roughly 50% multiple choice and 50% short answer.

The lecture notes page contains information on which sections we reached in
the course.  I will post a more detailed exam breakdown tomorrow, as I did for
the midterm.

Good luck, and I hope you enjoyed the course.  It was a pleasure being your instructor.

Don't forget to now go out and get [Network+](http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/network.aspx)
and [CCNA](http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/associate/ccna/index.html) certified! :)
