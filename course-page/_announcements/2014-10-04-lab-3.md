Ok folks, I admit defeat.  I have a wedding to attend today, and
can't stay up any longer working on lab 3.  True to my word, everyone
gets a 2% bonus (despite the fact that I know that 75% of you
aren't even ready to do lab 3 anyway). :)

Those who are ready to move on to the networking part of the assignment
should check out Beej's guide.  I will finish up the lab on Sunday.

Also, those having trouble with the 64-bit course VM should try out
the 32-bit version I've now created and uploaded:

    vagrant box remove cs3357
    vagrant box add cs3357 http://dl.cs3357.ca/cs3357-i386.box

You can then use it as shown in the lab manual, e.g.

    vagrant init cs3357
    vagrant up

Have a good weekend.
