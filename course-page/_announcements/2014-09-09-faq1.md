We're only doing the first 5 chapters.  It's 512 pages.  When you remove the end-of-chapter exercises and other extra pages, it works out to about 432 pages, if I recall correctly.  Divided by 12 weeks, that's only 36 pages/week or about 5 pages/day if you prefer to read daily.  A lot of the pages have diagrams and sidebars and other figures making it really a pretty quick read -- and I'm a very slow reader.

It's up to you whether or not you feel comfortable just attending lectures and not reading.  As I mentioned the other day, I'll be following the textbook closely, but, of course, due to time constraints, won't be able to explain things as in depth as the textbook does.  Exams will be written under the assumption that students are reading the textbook.
