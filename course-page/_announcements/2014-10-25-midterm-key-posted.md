The key for the midterm has been posted.

As discussed in class today, both (B) and (E) were accepted for the 
MX record question.  The correct answer is actually (E), since an
MX record contains the *hostname* of an SMTP server, and not an IP
address.  Both answers were accepted, however, since I originally
accepted (B) as the correct answer in error.

Five people were affected by this error and their marks were revised
accordingly in OWL.
