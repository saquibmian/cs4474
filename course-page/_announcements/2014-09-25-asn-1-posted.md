Assignment 1 is posted and will be due Friday October 17 at 23:59:59.
We'll say that weekends count as one day, so submitting the assignment by
23:59:59 on Monday October 20 will be 1 day late.  Try not to be late, though,
because your midterm is that week.

Feel free to email me with questions you might have.  The final lab needed
for the assignment should be ready tomorrow.  In the meantime, if you want
to get started, the assignment description contains a link to an excellent
socket programming tutorial.
