Assignment 2 is posted and will be due Friday November 14 at 23:59:59.
Once again, weekends count as one day, so submitting the assignment by
23:59:59 on Monday November 17 will be 1 day late.

Feel free to email me with questions you might have.  Labs 4 and 5 will
cover concepts helpful in completing this assignment and will be posted
by the weekend.

In the meantime, if you want to get started, see Beej's guide.

Also, I don't think this assignment should take you as long as Assignment 1.
Nevertheless, try to get started early.
