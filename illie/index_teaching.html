                    We live during the computer revolution, which is changing fast everything around us. While programming languages change fast, the basic underlying theory does not. This course covers the basic concepts of the theory of computation. To study computation thoroughly, we need models. Ideally, we would like simple models to solve our problems. This is what the theory of computation is about: computational models and their power, with an impressive array of applications. That includes finite state machines, regular expressions, push-down automata, and context-free grammars. A crucial aspect is studying the limits of computations, which involves investigating all powerful models, such as Turing machines. Some problems are intractable, that is, it takes ages to solve them, others are provably impossible to solve even on an infinitely powerful computer. Computability theory sheds light on these issues of fundamental importance to anyone attempting to understand what computers can do for us.
                    
                    Prerequisites
                    
                    Computer Science 2214: Discrete Structures for Computing or Mathematics 2155: Discrete Structures I, or registration in the third or fourth year of an honors program that combines Computer Science and other mathematical science, or SE 2251A/B (251A/B) and registration in the third year of the BESc program in Software Engineering.
                    Unless you have either the prerequisites for this course or written special permission from your Dean to enrol in it, you will be removed from this course and it will be deleted from your record.
                    This decision may not be appealed. You will receive no adjustment to your fees in the event that you are dropped from a course for failing to have the necessary prerequisites.

                    Course description
                    
                    The purpose of this course is to provide students with foundations in the basic concepts of data structures and algorithms. The main objective of the course is to teach the students how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems that they might encounter. Students will be exposed to a variety of data structures, their advantages and disadvantages, and will learn when different data structures are useful. This course is also about ensuring that students understand basic algorithms for manipulating these data structures and using them in varying informatics and analytics domains.
                    Topics covered in this course include:
                    Stacks and queues
                    Lists
                    Recursion
                    Analysis of Algorithms
                    Trees, binary search trees, multi-way search trees
                    Dictionaries, hash tables
                    Graphs, graph traversals, graph algorithms
                    Sorting and searching
                    "Computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists."
                    (The New York Times, 2012)
                    
                    This course is aiming at teaching computational skills for non-computer science students. It is a fact that people lacking such skills are and will increasingly be at disadvantage in all areas of activities. Simply put, to solve a problem using a computer one needs an algorithmic solution and a computer program implementing it. By learning a programming language (e.g., by attending CS2120, a prerequisite for this course), students took an important step towards acquiring a computational background by learning how to translate a solution into code. However, this is of little use without the ability to create the algorithmic solution to solve the problem. The crucial ability that is necessary is "computational thinking" and this course aims specifically at developing it.
