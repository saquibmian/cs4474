My research interests are in developing robust and efficient algorithms which automatically interpret visual information. In particular I am interested in visual correspondence (stereo, motion), and  image segmentation. Optimization techniques are of fundamental importance to computer vision problems. In my research I find graph algorithms and dynamic programming particularly useful for efficiently solving optimization problems arising in vision.
