Olga Veksler received BS degree summa cum laude with honors in mathematics and computer science from New York University in 1995, and a Msc and PhD degrees from Computer Science Department, Cornell University in 1999. She was a postdoctoral research associate at NEC Research Institute. She is currently an associate professor with Computer Science Department University of Western Ontario. Her broad research interests are in computer vision. In particular, she is interested in energy minimization methods, graph algorithms, stereo correspondence, motion, and segmentation. She was a co-organizer of IEEE Computer Society Workshop on Perceptual Organization in Computer Vision (POCV) in 2008. She has served on numerous program committees for the top vision conferences and as an area chair for CVPR'10 and CVPR'11. She is a recipient of the Early Researcher Award (ERA) from the Canadian Ministry of Research and Innovation, the NSERC Discovery Accelerator Supplement (DAS) Award, and  a "Test-of-Time Award" at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2011).
