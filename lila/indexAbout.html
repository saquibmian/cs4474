				<div class="box-content">
					Lila Kari is Professor in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Western Ontario. She received her M.Sc. in 1987 from the Univesity of Bucharest, Romania, and her Ph.D. in 1991 for her thesis "On Insertions and Deletions in Formal Languages", for which she received the Nevanlinna Prize for the best mathematics thesis in Finland. Author of more than 200 peer reviewed articles, Professor Kari is regarded as one of the world's experts in the area of biomolecular computation, that is using biological, chemical and other natural systems to perform computations. She is Editor-in-Chief for the journal Theoretical Computer Science, responsible for Part C - Natural Computing. She has served as Steering Committee Chair for the DNA Computing and Molecular Programming conference series, as Steering Committee member for the Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation conference series, as well as on the Scientific Advisory Committee of the International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering . She serves on the editorial boards of the journals Theoretical Computer Science, Natural Computing and Journal of Universal Computer Science , on the advisory board for the EATCS-Springer series Monographs in Theoretical Computer Science and Texts in Theoretical Computer Science, and as section editor for the Handbook of Natural Computing (Springer Verlag, 2012) . She has additionally served as a member of the Board of Directors of the FIELDS Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, the UK EPSRC Peer Review College , on the NSERC Grant Selection Committee on Computing and Information Systems and the NSERC Herzberg-Brockhouse-Polanyi Prize joint selection committee. At the University of Western Ontario she has received numerous awards, including the Florence Bucke Science Prize and the Faculty of Science Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. From 2002 to 2011 she was Canada Research Chair in Biocomputing, and her current research focusses on theoretical aspects of bioinformation and biocomputation, including models of cellular computation, nanocomputation by DNA self-assembly and Watson-Crick complementarity in formal languages.
