This folder holds two main files

## app.routes.js
Route config for the AngularJs app. This will allow for multiple routes in our pages, if it’s necessary (e.g., like linking to a specific tab).

## bootstrap.js
Initialize code for AngularJs. As new widgets become available, we’ll add a reference to their source file in here.
